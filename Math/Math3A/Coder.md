F23 Huber

Before I start, I just want to encourage all of you to take MATH 3A and not ICS 6N if possible. ICS 6N is just an inferior version of MATH 3A but with NumPy so that the instructors can convince you that it is totally an ICS course. (Note: This advice mostly applies to Gopi’s section of ICS 6N.)

Linear algebra might seem like an odd subject for CS majors to learn — for the most part, you probably will not encounter anything that requires heavy use of linear algebra unless you decide to go into machine learning, quantum computing, or the like. However, the concepts are so foundational and there are so many opportunities for interdisciplinary experiences that it would feel wrong to not include linear algebra into the major curriculum.

The class itself is straightforward — start with the common problem of solving a system of equations, before progressing into matrix operations and special cases that make them extremely versatile for many subjects.

Like with most courses in the MATH department, weekly quizzes are held in Discussion sections, there are some extra-hard exams, and a fat curve is applied at the end of the course. Huber’s class is no different. However, his exams are exceptionally (perhaps even excessively) difficult, as they test every nook and cranny of your understanding. Do you understand linear transformations? Do you understand null spaces? Well, here’s a problem that combines both concepts.

Considering that exams are such a high weight on your grade, this class is no joke. The concepts might seem simple at first, but Huber always likes to find those small crevices where you might have a gap in your understanding. The end result is a stressful, yet highly rewarding course. You’ll probably come out a stronger student.
