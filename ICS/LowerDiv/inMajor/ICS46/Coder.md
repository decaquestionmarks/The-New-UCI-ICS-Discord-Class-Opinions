This is another one of the so-called “weeders” of the CS major — it goes in-depth into the various data structures (and some algorithms) that will be very useful for problem solving. These are quite foundational to CS as a whole, so it is of utmost importance that you learn and understand these topics. It uncovers the layer of abstraction below commonly used structures like the map/dictionary, allowing you to understand why the time complexity of various operations are what they are. The various algorithms you learn in this course will be very applicable to later courses, so make sure you understand them.

The class is to some extent a flipped classroom, though not to the extent of Gassko. You do readings before class to introduce the material and get a general understanding of the basic structure/algorithm, then the associated lecture primarily focuses on applications of and problem-solving with that structure/algorithm.

Projects usually have you implement a data structure or algorithm. They typically do not cause issues, but in the case of projects that ask you to implement a structure, they can be quite long.

Exams are “just right” difficulty-wise, with some freebies thrown in there to test basic knowledge and then some harder application problems like those seen in lecture. This is one of the first courses you’ll encounter where “knowing the programming language” isn’t enough to do well in the class. These applications require creativity and insight, and really, the only tried and true method to get good at cracking these problems is practice. You’ll hopefully be doing a lot of that during this course through the problem sets.
