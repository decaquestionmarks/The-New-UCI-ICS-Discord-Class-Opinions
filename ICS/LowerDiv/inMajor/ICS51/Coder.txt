S23 Nicolau

Sleeper course. Nicolau puts like zero effort into lecturing, and as you would expect, students put like zero effort into the class. The premise of the course is simple — start at the transistor level, then slowly work your way up the levels of abstraction. You then learn the gates, learn several components, and then eventually build up to a concise model of the von Neumann architecture that runs inside nearly every classical computer today. On the side, you learn how to code in MIPS assembly. On the surface, this makes for a really fun course.

In practice, Nicolau has extremely old slides that haven’t been updated in probably at least a decade, the TAs are in charge of teaching you the assembly component through their discussions, and the exams have almost nothing to do with the lectures. Realistically, you learn how to do these exams through the homework assignments, and then you just regurgitate the same exact procedure on the actual exam.

Realistically, you’re going to self-learn the entire time. The actual lecture content isn’t bad, though you’re probably going to doze off because Nicolau just cannot explain concepts concisely and will spend half of lecture explaining how a basic flip-flop or MUX works.
