Gassko F22

Interesting start to my first year. Gassko’s lecturing style is unlike other instructors — she doesn’t lecture during lecture times. Instead, the course is built on a flipped classroom format, where most of your learning is done through the ZyBook (and through videos that fill in some of the knowledge gaps). In my quarter, she used specification grading, though this is no longer the case for current offerings of 6B.

Unfortunately, for this reason, there is a lot of busywork — Gassko just provides you with the structure you need to learn, but nearly all the learning is done by yourself. You need to read the assigned ZyBooks section, do the participation activities, do the in-lecture activities, do the homeworks, and several midterms. It may get overwhelming, so stay on top of things. Exams will throw slight curveballs at you to separate people who understand the content from those who just regurgitate the textbook.

Content-wise, it’s pretty standard. You get a very simple overview of several topics of discrete math, but nothing really too in-depth (later courses will expand on this simple foundation). This includes logic, set theory, graph theory, Boolean algebra, and more. Overall, this class is one of the first litmus tests for how you’ll do in this major. If you fail to understand the concepts, you are going to have a rough time in later courses.

I know Gassko has a very low reputation, but trust me when I say that she’s unironically the best (i.e. least bad) professor of those teaching ICS 6B.
