S23 Klefstad

Klefstad does get a lot of criticism for his disorganization, but for the most part, this was a solid class to transition you out of Python and into C++. Homeworks were (mostly) well made, and the homework quizzes tangled very well with the assignment the quiz was based on. However, understand that this is a Klefstad class, and that this means several things:
- Ungodly amounts of deadlines (Reading Quiz, Homework, Homework Quiz)
- Erratic (and also completely irrelevant) anecdotes about his personal life
- Lots of small mistakes and posting assignments/autograders late.

If you can deal with that, you’re fine, and you’ll learn quite a bit too. You start out with the bare basic syntax, then progress to one of the most important data structures of undergraduate programming assignments — the linked list. Know this thing inside and out. It will show up again in future courses, where you’re expected to be proficient in using its interface (or even programming one from scratch).

Beyond that, you learn the basics of OOP in C++ and then progress to some useful structures and functions in the C++ standard library (std::vector being the big one).
