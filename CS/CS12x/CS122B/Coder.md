Also not my cup of tea, but **if you are thinking of going into the industry for web development or software engineering, this course is a must-take**. Why do I say this? Because this is a project course, and well, having a full-stack project on your resume will turn at least some heads (though CRUD apps don’t really impress recruiters anymore, unfortunately). You spend 10 weeks creating Fabflix, which is effectively just IMDb from Temu — it’s a website where users can browse for movies and purchase them. You slowly build up all the small components over time with a partner, then record a video demo to showcase the functionality of the website. There is a key focus on keeping your website secure and scalable. Have some fun with it — you should definitely be doing more than the bare minimum. These are just basic ETL pipeline shenanigans, after all.

There are three quizzes, but you really don’t have to worry about them. Don’t completely ignore them since they’re worth a decent part of your grade, but the bulk of your grade comes from the project.

Fair warning though: this class is undeniably heavy. If at all possible, do not take this course until you have coordinated with someone who you’d be willing to develop this project with for 10 weeks. That is, make sure you have a partner, and make sure you can work together with said partner. 

In the end, I think you’ll find your efforts worthwhile. Making a project of this scale is a pretty big accomplishment, all things considered. Just make sure you know what you’re getting into first.
