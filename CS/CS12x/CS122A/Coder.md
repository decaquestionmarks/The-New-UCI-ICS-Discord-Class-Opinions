W25 Nawab

Not my cup of tea, but I know a lot of students find this to be an essential course to take. This class gives a brief introduction into the theory behind database design, focuses on how to write a SQL query, and ends on optimization techniques. The content in this course is good to know if you will be working with databases in the future (which is very likely).

Unfortunately, one major setback for this course is how incredibly unorganized it is — this is not exactly the fault of the professor, who seems to take a hands-off approach to this course while the TAs run the class. You will have to deal with inconsistent instructions and some frustrating last-minute changes.

As for Nawab himself, he is a pretty average professor. He doesn’t exactly stand out in any way, good or bad. His lectures can be incredibly slow and dry — we definitely had issues with the lecture pacing (topics near the end were rushed because we spent way too much time on other topics).

Overall, this class is undemanding — at most, you might rip your hair out over the homework. Even the group project at the end of the quarter is very simple and quick. Just make sure you get good at writing and interpreting queries, since this class has a lot of them.
