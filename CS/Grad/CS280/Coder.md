F25 Panageas

Basically a free A, but I don’t think that’s why you’re taking this course, right? Covers the whole gist of Algorithmic Game Theory, with one big topic being the computation (or approximation) of Nash equilibria in various kinds of games (normal form, potential, etc.). Homeworks are mainly just algorithm design or proof-writing — can be very tricky. The project at the end is just summarizing a research paper and presenting it to the class.

It’s a very interest-based course, and Panageas doesn’t expect much of you. A lot of the lecture time is just dedicated to proving theorems and whatnot. I recommend having a decent math background (more specifically, you should probably at least have some familiarity with geometry, real analysis, and optimization for best results). Ideally, you probably want to have taken CS 162 and an upper-division stats course.
