F24 Goodrich

Difficulty-wise, this class is laughably easy — you take weekly Gradescope quizzes worth 10% of your grade, and the rest of your grade is concentrated into three projects that involve implementing solutions to a specific problem, collecting data on their performance, then writing a report. There is pseudo-code for nearly every single algorithm you have to code up — the brunt of the work comes from translating that pseudocode correctly. Data collection isn’t trivial, but once you nail it down for the first project, you should hopefully have very generalizable data collection code that you can modify to work with the other projects. Grading is absurdly lenient on the report — just hit all the rubric points and you’ll get full credit as long as your conclusions seem reasonable.

Content-wise, it’s not a lot. With a course like this, there’s not really much to be taught, so Goodrich just fills in the lecture time by surveying several topics and problems in which algorithm analysis is applicable. You don’t really go into depth with many of the topics, so don’t expect much. It gives you a nice introduction, however, to pique your interest if you ever want to actually dive deeper.
