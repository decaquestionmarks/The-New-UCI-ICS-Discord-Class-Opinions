Skills from ICS 6B, 6D, and 46 have all built up to this moment — this course takes a deep dive into several well-known problem-solving techniques for various CS problems. Astute programmers might recognize a lot of these techniques from LeetCode.

The problem-solving skills you will develop in this course definitely will aid your job search, and it is one of the courses where the content of it is fundamental to technical interviews. You cover divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and the greedy algorithm (Shindler has since added a fourth paradigm: network flow). Each of these get a whole unit dedicated to them, where various different problems that can be solved with this paradigm are presented in lecture, in discussion sections, and in problem sets.

Exams are simple — demonstrate basic knowledge of the problems discussed in lecture, then demonstrate that you can apply the programming paradigm to a new problem you haven’t seen before. The latter part is worth the majority of your grade in this class — you get two chances: once on the topic exam and once on the final. In other words, your biggest priority should be figuring out how to solve problems using the programming paradigms you learn in this course. This model does not reward regurgitation, so make sure you get good at applying these algorithms.

These skills are very useful, and the problem-solving skills will follow you as you progress through your programming education and career.
