Disclaimer that I will be heavily biased because this is the direction of research I want to go in. If you’ve taken a Shindler course, this will feel very familiar to you — printed handouts, preemptible final, high test weighting. The first third of the course is on fundamentals, the second third dives deeper into the principles of quantum information, and the final third is on the actual algorithms. Shion’s a great lecturer, though unfortunately, he will not be teaching here anymore.

The topics can definitely be intimidating, especially if your linear algebra background isn’t great. However, I’m quite impressed with Shion’s ability to actually condense these complicated topics into a digestible format. Exams are fairly standard and curved. Homeworks will expand on the concepts learned in lecture.

If you have any interest in this topic, I think you’ll love the course.
