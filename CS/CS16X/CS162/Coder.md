S25 Shindler

If you’ve taken a Shindler course, this is pretty much the same thing, but with different topics (and Shindler’s way more chill this time around). I think this course is so incredibly fundamental that I would recommend that everyone in CS take it. Computational complexity theory is just so all-encompassing in the field that I really think you’d be missing out on a good chunk of CS if you skipped this course.

You go over NFAs, PDAs, recognizability, NP-completeness, etc. — the whole deal. A good chunk of this class is dedicated to proof-writing, so be wary of that. However, all the proofs have a recognizable formula to them, so you probably don’t have to worry on that front. The four preemptible topics this time are: proving a language is regular, proving a language is context-free, proving a problem is undecidable, and proving that a problem is NP-complete.

Overall, everything I said about CS 161 applies here.
