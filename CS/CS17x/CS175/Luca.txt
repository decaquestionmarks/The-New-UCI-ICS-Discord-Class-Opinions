tldr: Can't give much of an opinion here 

This class is solely for you to make a project. I took it with Kask, but 
it doesn't really matter who's supervising you since you can work on basically
anything AI related. This is a good experience for building teamwork skills
and getting a nice project out of it.

Kask: Focuses on teaching RL during the first three weeks, then there's no in-person
meetings. (10/10)
