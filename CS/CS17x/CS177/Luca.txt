tldr: Great class

CS177 is stats. Just stats. The reason I say this is because it doesn't really fit 
into the "AI" part of CS17X at a glance, but it teaches you the backbone behind 
many of the probabilistic models you see in ML + DL. This course helps to understand
certain DL problems you might face later.

Sudderth: Amazing professor - class is taught really well, and things are taught intuitively.
