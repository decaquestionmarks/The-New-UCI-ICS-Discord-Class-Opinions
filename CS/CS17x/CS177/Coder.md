F25 Sudderth

The course lives up to its title. I think this is honestly one of the most well-structured courses in the CS department, and I also think this is a must-take for anyone interested in the theoretical side of CS. This isn’t just a class for AI/ML enthusiasts — there are applications to computer graphics, algorithm analysis, and discrete processes.

Sudderth is an amazing and engaging lecturer; as cliche as it might sound, I think the slides are really just all killer, no filler. You learn about a topic (such as a continuous distribution) and then it’s immediately followed up by an application of said topic. The homeworks are primarily application-focused, testing whether you can apply specific distributions to analyze the average case of insertion sort, for instance.

Exams are a little on the difficult side, but Sudderth normalizes and gives bonus points for turning in your homework on time, so you don’t have to worry much about that. I honestly believe you don’t need much of a background from STATS 67 to succeed here, as long as you have at least rudimentary familiarity with the content. Overall, it’s a really great course that opens your eyes to the vast possibilities of probability applications.
