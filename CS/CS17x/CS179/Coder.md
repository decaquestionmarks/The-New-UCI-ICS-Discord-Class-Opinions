S25 Ihler

My general thoughts about Ihler are the same as my feelings in CS 178, so I won’t bore you with that aspect — lectures are dense, Ihler definitely knows the content well, and you will learn a lot in this course. Here, there are no exams. It’s just homeworks, a project, and weekly Canvas participation quizzes (they just check if you’ve been following along with the content — don’t worry).

Now, I could copy-and-paste like two-thirds of my CS 178 thoughts here, but I won’t so as to save space. This course effectively takes the Bayesian networks and Markov chains you were introduced to in CS 171… then cranks them up to 11. Probabilistic graph models are quite huge for simulation and inference. If you are interested in AI, I think this course is a must-take. Monte Carlo methods, Ising machines, and Hidden Markov Models are all quite fundamental to the field of AI.

This is about as close to a graduate course as you’re getting with undergraduate courses. Be warned that the content is not trivial and that you’ll probably need at least some extensive math background to understand the inner workings of some of the things he’s talking about. However, I think your brain will expand tenfold if you just follow along.
