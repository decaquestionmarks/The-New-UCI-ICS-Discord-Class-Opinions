tldr: Important class!

CS178 is machine learning, and a plunge into the deep end. Without an ML background,
this class puts you through the wringer. You'll have to learn a lot each week.
I personally advise you to look up "Statquest" as it'll be helpful in dumbing down what you
learn in class such that you understand it later.

Berg: Really good professor with a great background (He worked on a foundational CV paper),
despite some mishaps with the teaching of the class, it's not super bad (7/10)
