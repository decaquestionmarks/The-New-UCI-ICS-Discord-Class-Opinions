tldr: So good its a religious experience.

You should take CS172B if you're interested in the math behind Neural Networks, simply put.
It's very theory heavy, and you will need to put some time outside of class to understand
things deeply. However, it will fully clarify how deep learning works.

Baldi: Baldi has been working with neural networks since the 2000's, works on
a variety of deep learning research, and is extremely well educated. His classes move
fast, but if you pay attention, you will get an incredible amount of experience out of it.

Additionally, he has a project requiring the use of a neural network, which I think 
is great for your resume, if it benefits from a DL project. (10/10)
