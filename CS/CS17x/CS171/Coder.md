W25 Kask

Ripping off the bandage here to say that this honestly might just be one of the most disorganized classes I have ever taken at UC Irvine. I’m sure Kask has at least somewhat improved since I took it, but that does not excuse how absolutely infuriating my quarter was. The course structure is kind of standard — quizzes, project, final. However, our quarter, he decided to do some experimentation. On top of the online Canvas quizzes he had in the past, he decided to add in-person quizzes on top! What on earth is the point of having both weekly Canvas quizzes and biweekly in-person quizzes?

Oh, now for the actual course itself. Almost everything is adopted from Prof. Lathrop’s (RIP) offering of the course, and I’m pretty sure almost nothing about it has changed since. Canvas quizzes are still annoying and vague and the AI Checkers project code is coded up in Python 3.5 or something (and at times doesn’t even function correctly).

Now for the worst part — the in-person quizzes were actually disgusting. They were held through PollEv, which I mean, okay, I don’t mind that… but Kask had zero clue how to use PollEv, so like the first two in-person quiz attempts just got completely butchered. When he finally managed to get an in-person quiz working, it was… one question. No partial credit. You get that one question wrong? That’s -3% to your course grade. Eventually, we convinced Kask to include a participation component (and downweigh the correctness part like… twice). However, that doesn’t excuse just how much of an abomination these would be, considering they had no set schedule and Kask would announce these quizzes whenever he felt like it.

The project was… fine, I guess. They really could not release the opponent AIs in a timely manner, but whatever. Pissed me off, but I was already so vexed about the in-person quiz mishaps to even care at that point.

Lectures were relatively unentertaining, but the content was fine, even if it was just a poor mishmash of a bunch of courses I had already previously taken.
