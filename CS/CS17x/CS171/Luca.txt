tldr: Meh

CS171 is a good class depending on who you take it with. 

If you categorize AI into GOFAI, ML, and DL, its mostly GOFAI with a bit of ML.

Kask (I took): Kask's 171 took too long on "outdated" things, such as first and second 
order logic (which you would already know), constraint satisfaction, Bayesian networks, ETC.
The one part of Kask's class you might find interesting is Monte Carlo techniques for 
adversarial games, which are a big part of what is needed for his project. (5/10)

Koenig (Didn't take): I have heard great things about Koenig's offering of 171. He delves into
more "practical" parts of GOFAI, and some ML, such as Simulated Annealing, RL,
so on and so forth. This is your ideal "CS17X" precursor class.
