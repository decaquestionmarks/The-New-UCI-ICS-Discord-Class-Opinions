W25 Gillespie

You might want to tamper your expectations for this one. I found this course kind of useless and outdated. Gillespie also finds this course outdated to some extent. The course structure and materials were adopted from Prof. Ziv, so it’s very standard (mandatory attendance, weekly Canvas quizzes, three homeworks). Entertaining lecturer — I really loved the James Webb telescope guest lecture. The course itself is kind of free if you put even an ounce of effort.

Gillespie knows how to respect your time. He adds some additional anecdotes about the industry (because he is a software engineer himself). It’s just kind of a shame that the curriculum is like this. Overall I don’t exactly have much to say. This class was effectively just a big nothingburger, but Gillespie at the very least keeps you entertained for the 10 weeks you’re sitting in his lectures.
